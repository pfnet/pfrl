This algorithm trains a Q-function that receives an observation and returns an expected future return for each action the agent can take. In PFRL, you can define your Q-function as `torch.nn.Module` as below. Note that the outputs are wrapped by `pfrl.action_value.DiscreteActionValue`. By wrapping the outputs of Q-functions, PFRL can support not only discrete-action Q-functions like this but also continuous-action Q-functions (via [Normalized Advantage Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748)) in the same way."
