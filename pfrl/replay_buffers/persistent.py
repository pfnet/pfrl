class PersistentReplayBuffer(ReplayBuffer):
    """Experience replay buffer that are saved to disk storage

    :py:class:`ReplayBuffer` is used to store sampled experience data, but
    the data is stored in DRAM memory and removed after program termination.
    This class add persistence to :py:class:`ReplayBuffer`,
    so that the learning process can be restarted from a previously saved replay
    data.

    Args:
        dirname (str): Directory name where the buffer data is saved.
            Please note that it tries to load data from it as well. Also, it
            would be important to note that it can't be used with ancestor.
        capacity (int): Capacity in terms of number of transitions
        ancestor (str): Path to pre-generated replay buffer. The `ancestor`
            directory is used to load/save, instead of `dirname`.
        logger: logger object
        distributed (bool): Use a distributed version for the underlying
            persistent queue class. You need the private package `pfrlmn`
            to use this option.
        group: `torch.distributed` group object. Only used when
            `distributed=True` and pfrlmn package is available

    .. note:: Contrary to the original :py:class:`ReplayBuffer`
            implementation, ``state`` and ``next_state``, ``action`` and
            ``next_action`` are pickled and stored as different objects even
            they point to the same object. This may lead to inefficient usage
            of storage space, but it is recommended to buy more
            storage - hardware is sometimes cheaper than software.
